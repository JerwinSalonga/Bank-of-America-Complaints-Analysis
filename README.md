## Insights Deep-Dive

### Peak Complaint Month in July 2023

Complaint volumes have generally trended upward since 2020, with a dramatic spike in July 2023. This surge, representing a 174% increase over the monthly average,  was driven by the increase of complaints related to checking or savings accounts, which accounted for 869 cases. 

![[Pasted image 20250506210942.png|600]]  

The most common issues within this category were managing an account, opening an account, and problems with lenders or companies charging accounts. This suggests that consumers faced notable challenges with their banking services during this period, possibly due to changes in account management processes, new fees, or disruptions in service.

![[Pasted image 20250506235906.png|600]] 

Credit card and prepaid card complaints also contributed to the spike, with 486 cases. The leading issues here were problems with purchases shown on statements, other features or terms, and fees or interest. This indicates that many consumers experienced difficulties with their credit card transactions and account features.

Geographically, the spike was most pronounced in states with large populations, such as California, Florida, and Texas, but the trend was observed nationwide.

### Product and Issue Concentration

Banking products, particularly checking and savings accounts, are at the heart of consumer dissatisfaction, accounting for 46% of all complaints. Credit card and prepaid card issues follow closely, making up 28%. The most common issues reported include managing accounts, incorrect information on credit reports, and problems with purchases or account charges. These recurring themes point to systemic challenges in account management, transaction transparency, and credit reporting accuracy.

### Complaint Resolution Outcomes

While companies respond to most complaints in a timely manner (93.8%), the nature of these resolutions varies. The majority (65.7%) are closed with an explanation, while 23.5% result in monetary relief and 8.4% in non-monetary relief. Only a small fraction remain in progress. This distribution suggests that while companies are generally responsive, there is room to improve the quality and impact of their resolutions, especially for complex or recurring issues.

### Digital Shift and Response Delays During COVID-19

From 2017 to 2023, **web** became the dominant complaint channel, surging during the **COVID-19 pandemic**.

This shift strained response systems. Complaints submitted online saw **more untimely responses** in 2020 vs 2021, suggesting that financial firms struggled to keep up with rising digital volumes.

### Complaints with untimely responses

The data shows a sharp increase in untimely complaint responses beginning in 2020 and peaking in 2021, indicating a strong COVID-19 impact on operational efficiency. Although there's a downward trend post-2021, 2022 (560 complaints) and 2023 (529 complaints) figures remain above pre-pandemic levels, suggesting a "new normal" in response times.

![[Pasted image 20250506225939.png|600]]

Untimely responses during this period were related to basic banking services (checking/savings accounts), suggesting that banks may have been particularly challenged in maintaining response times. On the other hand, the most delayed issues involved “Managing an account” and “Incorrect information on reports,” implying that these complex or high-touch cases are more difficult to resolve within standard timeframes.

## Recommendations
### Strengthen Peak Period Readiness  
* Proactive Monitoring & Resource Allocation: Allocate additional resources and staff training ahead of anticipated complaint surges, particularly in the summer months, to maintain service quality during high-demand periods.
* **Crisis-Responsive Playbooks**: Develop flexible response protocols to handle sudden complaint influxes tied to account management or credit product issues.

### Improve Banking Product Experience
* Audit High-Issue Products: Conduct end-to-end reviews of checking/savings account workflows and credit card transaction systems to identify pain points causing consumer frustration.
* **Enhance Issue Transparency**: Provide clearer, real-time updates to consumers on disputes, account actions, and fees to reduce complaints related to confusion or misinformation.

### Boost Resolution Quality and Clarity  
* **Refine Resolution Strategies**: Shift toward more impactful complaint resolutions, including monetary/non-monetary relief, especially for recurring and complex issues.
* **Follow-Up Mechanism**: Implement post-resolution follow-ups for select cases to confirm consumer satisfaction and gather feedback for service improvement.

### Optimize Digital Complaint Handling
* **Scale Digital Support Systems**: Invest in automation and AI triaging tools to manage growing online complaint volumes and minimize response delays.
* **Channel-Specific Training**: Equip teams with the tools and training to resolve web-submitted complaints efficiently, especially during crisis periods.

### Address Root Causes of Delayed Responses
* Specialized Support Teams: Create task forces focused on handling complex issues like “Managing an account” and “Incorrect credit information” to reduce resolution times.
* **Process Benchmarking**: Analyze and streamline internal processes for banking-related complaints to eliminate bottlenecks causing repeated delays.

## Assumptions, and Caveats

* Assumption of Data Accuracy: The analysis assumes that the complaint records are correctly logged and categorized by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), with no major reporting errors or duplicates.
* Subset of Complaints: The dataset may not represent all consumer complaints, only those submitted and published by CFPB, which could underrepresent certain industries or regions.
* No Direct Causality: Observed correlations (e.g., untimely responses during COVID-19 or seasonal spikes) are not definitive proof of causation and may be influenced by other external factors.
* Focus on Key Categories: The analysis prioritized top categories and issues to highlight major trends, which may omit less frequent but important complaint types.
